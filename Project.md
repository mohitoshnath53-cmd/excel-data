Physiological dataset for IoT-based health monitoring using Bi-LSTM

# Intelligent IoT-Based Health Surveillance System (Bi-LSTM)

This project implements an IoT-based smart health monitoring system for real-time acquisition and analysis of physiological parameters. Heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and body temperature are collected using low-cost biomedical sensors and transmitted via a NodeMCU ESP8266 to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for secure storage and visualization.

To enable intelligent health assessment, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model is used to analyze sequential sensor data and classify health status as healthy or unhealthy. The bidirectional learning approach improves temporal pattern recognition and diagnostic reliability compared to traditional threshold-based methods.

The system follows a hybrid edge–cloud architecture, ensuring low latency, scalability, and energy-efficient operation. Owing to its cost-effective and non-invasive design, the project is suitable for remote patient monitoring, telemedicine, and smart healthcare applications.
